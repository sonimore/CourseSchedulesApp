# CourseSchedulesApp
(This application is still in progress).
An application that includes:
1. A data scraper that gets data from Carleton College's online course catalog,
2. An API that queries data from a postgres database, and
3. Displays course information and professor ratings from ratemyprofessor.com, and allows users to browse courses by subject.

Future work:
1. Allow users the option to select courses and generate potential course schedules from the selected courses,
2. Create a UI that is aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate,
3. Include more browsing and filtering options.
