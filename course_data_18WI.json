While this is certainly a collaborative endeavor, recent decades have seen a marked increase in \"devised theater,\" a mode intended to upset the traditional hierarchies of theatrical production. In practical terms, this means the abandonment of the extant text in favor of a performance \"score\"--sometimes textual, often physical--developed improvisationally in rehearsal by the performers. This course will explore the methods and approaches used to work in this collective and highly creative manner, and will culminate in a public performance. We will also discuss the history and cultural politics that inform devised practice.", "course_num": "THEA 345.00", "end_time": "11:55am", "faculty": "Roger K Bechtel", "department": "THEA", "credits": "6 credits", "start_time": "10:10am", "size": "12"}, {"term": "18WI", "title": " Integrative Exercise ", "registered": "0", "summary": "n/a", "course_num": "THEA 400.00", "end_time": "n/a", "faculty": "Staff", "department": "THEA", "credits": "1-6 credits, S/CR/NC only", "start_time": "n/a", "size": "10"}, {"term": "18WI", "requirements_met": ["Humanistic", "Inquiry", "Intercultural", "Domestic", "Studies"], "title": " Introduction to LGBT/Queer Studies ", "registered": "28", "summary": "This course is an introduction to the interdisciplinary examination of sexual desires, sexual orientations, and the concept of sexuality generally, with a particular focus on the construction of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender identities.
