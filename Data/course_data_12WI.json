Motivated by a failed attempt to prove Fermat's last theorem, we define the ring of integers, examine the failure of unique factorization, and rehabilitate it somewhat by showing that ideals have unique factorization into prime ideals. Further topics may include the finiteness of the class number, units in rings of integers, relations to Galois theory, cyclotomic fields, class number formulas, and the Chebotarev density theorem.
