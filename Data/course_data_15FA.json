For another thing, the distinction between chaos and order shapes discussions of ethics and human psychology. How should we understand inner conflict, for example? Can reason establish order in our souls by ruling over the emotions? Finally, it is central to political philosophy. Several thinkers, in particular, tried to understand the seeming chaos and conflict associated with democracy by comparing it with the mythical ideal of benevolent, all-powerful kings. In this course, designed as an introduction to ancient philosophy, we will see how this theme appears in texts from the Presocratics to Epicurus.
