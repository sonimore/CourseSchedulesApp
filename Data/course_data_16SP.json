What role should pleasure play in human life? What is the best way to address difference and disagreement within a political community?

The most obvious source of raw data is sense experience, and the most obvious candidates for modes of right reasoning are deduction, induction, and abduction. Some philosophers, however, think that sense perception is only one of several sources of raw data (perhaps we also have a faculty of pure intuition or maybe a moral sense), and others have doubted that we have any source of raw data at all. As for the modes of \"right\" reasoning, Hume famously worried about our (in)ability to justify induction, and others have had similar worries about abduction and even deduction.
